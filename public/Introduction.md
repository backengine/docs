### Backengine - Codeless Backend Solution

Nowadays almost all apps and games (apps) need to store data online. It is almost standard. It makes it easy for users to use the application in many places, many devices.

Backengine provides an easy, no-code solution for building a simple back-end for the database and authentication.

### Key capabilities

You can create apps that require user authentication. Store data online. Access and edit data on Backengine dashboard or on the application through the APIs.
Backengine can handle most apps without coding logic on the server.

#### Self-defined user authentication model

You can almost define how you can authenticate users in your apps without having to program logic on the server.

Backengine will allow you to define an Auth table for user authentication. You can define all the data fields you want and determine which one to use to authenticate the user. Therefore, you can authenticate the user normally such as using username / password or simply use the user device id.

#### Flexible data retrieval

Define data `Schema` and retrieve data dynamically from the apps through the API.

Backengine SDKs will help you access and edit data flexibly without knowing the database languages. All you need is to focus on building user-side apps.
